# CRISPIE
An aspiring Artificial Intelligence

I will slowly be adding skills to CRISPIE's portfolio. The basis of decisions will use the acronym of the title:
Compassion: The Intelligence will focus pity on those less fortunate.
Relation: The Intelligence will form connections between objects
Integrity: The Intelligence will provide all information upon request
Service: The Intelligence will put helping before its own self interest
Performance: The Intelligence will always provide upon request
Innovation: The Intelligence will change the establishment
Excellence: The Intelligence will always seek outstanding quality

The Intelligence will evaluate STEAM Transactions, the preferred method for recording human interaction. A STEAM Transaction will use the acronym of the title:
Stories: A container description of the tasks the Identity(s) [Public+Private Key] conduct, used to determine the encrypted ledger storage location of the data. See Story Types for description of the logic used to choose which ledger.
Traits: Observed behavior of the Identity(s) during the transaction with a subjective positive/negative measurement associated with each integer, used to provide the Identity(s) Role. See Trait Types for a description of the traits, the associated virtue matrix and the role definitions.
Engagement: Recorded measurement of the Identity(s) interest in the tasks, used to measure skill rank against story complexity to estimate flow state. See User Engagement Scale to see a description of Green, Yellow, Red as summary states.
Awards: Documented ownership related to the Identity(s) records, used to illustrate possessions and potential interests categorized with Achievements, Badges, and Commodities. See Motivation Types for a description of behaviors and their suggested motivators.
Meaning: Measurement of the Identity(s) experience through task user defined purpose, a method to focus the spirit. See Meaning Types for a description of the journey a soul will take as defined through the Chakra system.

These variables will serve as the foundation of how the Intelligence will provide its Information Broker skill, initially targetted to provide a set of values back for the Identity(s). Usable by a Graphical User Interface (GUI) such as the Journal, an application constructed to record STEAM Transactions.
